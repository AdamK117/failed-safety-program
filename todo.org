* TODO Implement selection logic
** TODO Implement a proper hierarchy that is flexible to future changes
*** Should allow consumers to select sub items that they are in control of
*** Should allow multiple selection of the sub items
*** Controllers at the top of the hierarchy must be able to see selections across consumers
* TODO Implement hotkey logic
** A top-down hotkey poller will be used for the majority of commands that act in predicatble ways
** This will not apply for the likes of textboxes (which will remove the hotkey pollers effect)
* TODO Implement plugins for application components
** Application components should be implemented as standalone plugins if possible. This is idealized, because it will be difficult to -completely- encapsulate the necessary components for plugin functionality but it would be a much cleaner, less coupled, way of handling application components.
